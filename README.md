# Banking-System

This project is based on a secure banking system that provides a password-protected account. Whenever the user creates an account with an account number he will get a unique password. Next time when he logged in his account, he must require the account number and the password provided by the system. They can also change the password of their account. As no database is used in this project, the data will temporarily be stored in the RAM. After ending the program the data will be automatically deleted from RAM.
