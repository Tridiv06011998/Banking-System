# Banking-System

This project is based on a secure banking system that provides a password-protected account. Whenever one creates an account with an account number he/she will get a unique password. Next time when he/she logged in his/her account, he/she must require the account number and the password provided by the system. They can also change the password of their account. The data will be securely stored in the MySQL database.
